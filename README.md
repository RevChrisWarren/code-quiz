# code-quiz

## This is a timed quiz with questions about javascript. When the user begins, they have two minutes to answer 10 multiple choice questions. The time left on the timer is the user's score.
## When an answer is selected, the user receives immediate feedback whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
## An incorrect answer takes ten seconds off the timer.
## When there are no more questions, the user will be given their score. If their score is higher than the previous high score, they are prompted for their initials and the new highscore and their initials are stored in localStorage.
## The user is then asked whether they would like to play again. If the answer is yes, the site reloads. If the answer is no, the alert goes away, and the user can navigate to another page.
